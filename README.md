Write a Golang server.  Which accepts GET and POST http methods Post Method should read the request body and store it  in a struct(you can create a struct of your choice). GET should return a struct converted to json (you can hardcode the data for struct). [optional] You can store the POST apiâ€™s data in a file and return all the data when GET api is called.  Instructions : call the api using curl ,take a screenshot.
